CSS Colors
The color property of CSS helps to set the color of the HTML element(s). This helps to set the foreground color of text, text decorations, and borders.

Syntax:
/* Syntax
selector {
    color: value
} 
*/
selector {
    /* colorname can be any colour, such as red, blue, yellow, purple, green, etc. */
    color: colorname
}

Note: In CSS we use color, not colour.
